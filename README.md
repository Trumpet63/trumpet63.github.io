## Personal Rules
If I'm hosting a project here that also exists in its own repo (which most of them should), then I should just copy/paste the bundle.js into a page folder. In other words, don't re-build those projects. Keep that repo as the single source of truth. And I can link to it if I really want people to see the source code.
