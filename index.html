        title="Perceptrum Music Visualizer"
        href="perceptrum-music-visualizer.html"
        description="A customizeable procedural music visualization app that visualizes the waveform of a given music file as it plays and adds various visual effects based on the computed frequency of the on-screen chunk. Uses fft.js to compute the frequency. The demo song is Final Flight by Chronox (CC-BY)"

        title="Gravity Simulation Using Particles"
        href="cpu-gravity-particles.html"
        description="Simulates 40,000 particles arranged in a plane in 3D space being subjected to gravitational attraction to a point above the plane. The particles are rendered to the screen by casting a ray from each particle toward the camera and determining the intersection with the view plane (contrary to the typical method of casting a ray from the camera). This is done without a shader - it's all software-based rendering. It's not computed with a high degree of physical accuracy or precision; it's mostly just fun to watch."

        title="Spin Warrior"
        href="spin-warrior.html"
        description="A simple top-down arena game with an unusual control method: use your mouse to spin your warrior faster by dragging and releasing (kind of like a swipe motion on a smartphone, but it IS intended to be played on PC). The 2D world is randomly generated and the edges wrap around. Staying in certain environments will give your character that environment's element, and give you damage bonuses against enemies of the opposite element. Made in 48 hours for a game jam."
