        title="Gravity Simulation Using Particles"
        href="cpu-gravity-particles.html"
        description="Simulates 40,000 particles arranged in a plane in 3D space being subjected to gravitational attraction to a point above the plane. The particles are rendered to the screen by casting a ray from each particle toward the camera and determining the intersection with the view plane (contrary to the typical method of casting a ray from the camera). This is done without a shader - it's all software-based rendering. It's not computed with a high degree of physical accuracy or precision; it's mostly just fun to watch."
