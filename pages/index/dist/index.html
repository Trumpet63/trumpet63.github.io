        project="Creative Destruction"
        href="creative-destruction.html"
        description="A top-down 2D puzzle/art game about making sacrifices. Made in 48 hours for a game jam with some polish added afterwards. Most of the assets come from the Kenny Roguelike/RPG pack (CC0)."

        project="Perceptrum Music Visualizer"
        href="perceptrum-music-visualizer.html"
        description="A customizeable procedural music visualization app that visualizes the waveform of a given music file as it plays and adds various visual effects based on the computed frequency of the on-screen chunk. Uses fft.js to compute the frequency. The demo song is Final Flight by Chronox (CC-BY)."

        project="Floating Arrows"
        href="floating-arrows.html"
        description="A music visualization animation built off of Perceptrum that I used for introductions to my livestreams. Resizes to fit the size of the browser window. Adds supports playing a sequence of songs like a playlist. Adds the id3.js library to parse out song title and artist name. Still uses fft.js to compute the frequency. The demo song is Space by HolinzaCC0."

        href="notejive-noteskin-editor.html"
        description="An image editor specifically for designing noteskins for rhythm games. It features a layer system like a typical image editor, but rather than giving you various paintbrushes to draw with, you control the shape of the arrow by selecting control points and using sliders."

        project="Gravity Simulation Using Particles"
        href="cpu-gravity-particles.html"
        description="Simulates 40,000 particles arranged in a plane in 3D space being subjected to gravitational attraction to a point above the plane. The particles are rendered to the screen by casting a ray from each particle toward the camera and determining the intersection with the view plane (contrary to the typical method of casting a ray from the camera). This is done without a shader - it's all software-based rendering. It's not computed with a high degree of physical accuracy or precision; it's mostly just fun to watch."

        project="Spin Warrior"
        href="spin-warrior.html"
        description="A simple top-down 2D arena game with an unusual control method: use your mouse to spin your warrior faster by dragging and releasing (kind of like a swipe motion on a smartphone, but it IS intended to be played on PC). The 2D world is randomly generated and the edges wrap around. Staying in certain environments will give your character that environment's element, and give you damage bonuses against enemies of the opposite element. Made in 48 hours for a game jam."

        project="Greenest Emoji Project"
        href="greenest-emoji.html"
        description="An app I made to help me explore the problem of which Microsoft Teams emoji is the greenest. Why, you ask? Because at work my team would use any green emoji to indicate approval, like approving a merge, and I wanted to be able to use the most exotic and unexpected green emojis. In this app I implemented 10 different scoring methods, a visualization of which pixels scored highest, the ability to sort by each scoring method, and a &quot;test&quot; function, which generates a diagnostic image of all the possible colors in order from most to least green based on any of the scoring methods."

        description="Inspired by Bunnymark, this is a basic benchmark that draws a bunch of arrows on the screen and animates them. It also lets you switch between using the 2D canvas API and WebGL to do the rendering."
